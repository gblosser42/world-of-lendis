Magic is a common sight on [[Lendis]], touching every aspect of life. In addition to the four Traditions, there are two major types of magic: invocations and rituals. Invocations, which include spells and cantrips, are short term bursts of magic shaped by words, gestures, and material components into an immediate effect. Invokers are most common among adventurers and soldiers, as the ability to cast quickly is of utmost importance. Rituals are slow magic workings that can take place on a much larger scale than invocations.

Most spellcasters know both invocations and rituals, but frequently specialize in one or the other. In addition to dedicated spellcasters, a significant minority of people know a simple cantrip or ritual to help with their daily lives. Most villages will have at least one person capable of casting common rituals as well as first rank spells. Towns will have access to second and third rank spells, with larger towns having fourth. Cities typically have access to fifth rank spells, with higher ranks being more common as the city grows larger. These are only loose guidelines. A village with access to third rank spells is uncommon, but by no means unheard of, for example.

In addition to the rituals presented in the rule books, there are several rituals common to Lendis - such as blessing fields to be more bountiful or warding an area against disease. The most significant, however, is the Bliss Ward. The Bliss Ward protects an area against [[The Nightmare|Nightmare]] incursions. Without it, cities would fall prey to Nightmares long before they could grow to their current size.

You trace the border of the area to be protected, warding it against Nightmares. A caster may have only one Bliss Ward ritual active at a time. Acting as the primary or secondary caster for a second Bliss Ward while the previous one is in effect results in the previous Bliss Ward being dismissed at the end of the casting. Only one Bliss Ward may be active in any given area. Nightmare incidents cannot arise within the border, and Nightmare creatures must succeed at a Will save against the primary caster's spell DC or class DC, whichever is higher. Only "pure" Nightmare creatures are blocked by the ward. Nightmare Warped creatures are unaffected by it, as are orcs.

**Critical Success** the creature is immune to the Bliss Ward and may enter the protected area freely
**Success** the creature may pass through the Bliss Ward, but must test again on subsequent attempts
**Failure** the creature may not pass through the Bliss Ward, treating it as an impassible barrier to movement. The creature may attempt another save 24 hours later.
**Critical Failure** as Failure, but the creature may not attempt another save until the ritual is re-cast.
