Marksgrav is one of two major city-states in the [[Riverlands]]. Marksgrav has close ties to [[Thaxhold]], and many Thaxholder goods make their way to distant markets aboard Marksgraver ships. The rivers are a frequent hotbed of low level raiding and border wars, and even the towns and villages that share allegiance to Marksgrav are liable to fight one another.

### History

The [[Riverlands]] have long been a hotbed of raiding and small scale warfare. The petty kings ruled their small fiefs with pride, and each one envisioning being at the head of a true empire. Sometimes, a city would rise in power and subjugate its neighbors, but never for long. Within a generation or two, the nascent empire's fortunes would turn, and the new state would collapse.

Until recently, Marksgrav was just like the other cities in the riverlands, raiding to steal what it can and only trading when warfare wasn't an option. Sixty years ago, Queen [[Frilga Deyonter]] rose to power in Marksgrav, the sixth member of her family to rule the city. Marksgrav had begun to transition to a mercantile state rather than raiding, and Queen Frilga wants to complete that transformation.

Now, Marksgrav stands as the head of a coalition of other towns and villages united in a trade alliance with Thaxhold. The wealth of the mountains flows down Marksgrav's rivers to the sea, and the people of Marksgrav prosper. But they have not forgotten their roots, and many feel uncomfortable with the rapid changes their culture has undergone.

### Culture

Marksgrav is a city marked by rapid transformation. Two hundred years ago, they were feared raiders. One hundred years ago, they were traders who crushed the competition with steel and blood. Now, they are 'civilized' and rich. More wealth flows freely into the city in a year as a result of trade than their ancestors would take by force in a decade. But the people of Marksgrav are not truly at ease with this new life.

Marksgravers have recently developed a strong dueling culture, both as a way to resolve disputes and as an outlet for the violence and war skills their culture still expects them to have. Some others have turned to piracy, boarding ships to find rival trade ships and take them by force. This is officially outlawed, but the Queen has struggled to make the ban stick.

### Government

Queen Frilga is the absolute ruler of Marksgrav, but the various towns and villages under Marksgrav's influence are not strictly part of her domain. On paper at least, the petty kings and overseers of each town still hold sway over their lands. But in reality, Frilga's word is law and few would dare risk their newfound prosperity to defy her.

Yet Queen Frilga is old now, and everyone knows she doesn't have long left to live. Her two children are ready to inherit, but it is impossible to tell what will become of her coalition when she dies. Will Marksgrav be the first true Empire of the [[Riverlands]]? Or will it be just one more in a long cycle of rise and fall? Everyone is positioning themselves to come out on top in the inevitable power struggle, and Marksgrav's fate will be decided by the outcome.

### Religion

Marksgrav follows [[The High Gods]], largely due to the immense influence [[Thaxhold]] has over the city. While Marksgravers do not delve for gems like their dwarven allies do, they have much more free access to the sky and the measurements of the stars. Marksgraver navigators are some of the best in the world as a result of their intense study of the stars and the movement of the night sky.

On a personal level, Marksgravers are likely to consult the priests when making business decisions, to read any advice the High Gods have for them and try to foretell the outcome. But there is also a rising portion of the population that follows [[the Unknown Gods]], believing they represent the true nature of the Riverlands better. This is common especially among Marksgrav's youth, who were raised on idealized stories of a glorious past and have never had to live through the terror of a raiding party.

### Military

Like most [[Riverlands]] cities, Marksgrav's military is based around individual groups. Rather than have a centralized regular army, each Marksgraver noble is expected to be able to raise a band of warriors as the need arises. Typically, these warriors are light infantry skilled at navigating and fighting in the marshy Riverlands. Most wear light mail or leather armor, carry a shield, and fight with sword and javelin. Large formations are uncommon, with most battles being between a few dozen combatants on either side, being small raids or border disputes rather than a true war. While Marksgrav itself no longer participates in these raids, many of the towns under its banner do.

When war threatens, these bands unite under the command of the Queen. While the nobles still command their individual warbands, they are expected to fight alongside each other and follow orders. The terrain of the Riverlands are poorly suited for cavalry operations, so even in war most battles are decided by foot soldiers.

Marksgrav's recent boom in wealth has allowed it to begin setting more advanced industries of its own. For the first time, heavier plate armor has become economically viable, and they are beginning to experiment with firearms. For the most part, the traditional arms and armor still dominate, but that may not be the case for long.

### Names

Marksgravers use relatively few names, with most children being named for a parent or grandparent. Families live in multi-generational halls named after a family legend or geographical feature. So Astrid, who lives in Longhallow Hall would be Astrid Longhallow. Recently, some Marksgravers are living in smaller homes away from their extended families, and taking surnames of their own, typically reflecting their profession or trade.
