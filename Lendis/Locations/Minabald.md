Minabald has long been a land dominated by the Elemental Courts, and the city itself stands at the junction of the four dominant elements. The sea, for water. The sands, for earth. The unforgiving heat, for fire. And the harsh winds that shift dunes and create sandstorms, for air. Here, the elemental planes touch Lendis most closely, and here elementals live alongside mortals.
### History

In many ways, the history of Minbald stretches back to the dawn of time, when elemental rifts opened at the potent crossroads of power located on the coast of the desert. The settlement recognizable as Minabald was only founded 3,000 years ago, however. At that time, the greatest [[The Elemental Lords|Elemental Lords]] reached an agreement and established a joint council to govern them and their conflicts. 

The mortals within Minabald have been a much more fleeting fixture. Originally, the city was only occupied by elementals living on the material plane, temporary agents and ambassadors. However, over time they mingled with the mortal population and produced lines of geniekin. These geniekin eventually became the bulk of the population, a permanent mortal representation of the elemental planes.

Recently, rich [[mana crystals]] have been discovered in the desert prompting a rush of [[Crystal Order|outside magi]] to settle in Minabald. This has also driven further expansion into and exploitation  of the desert, which has escalated the conflict with the [[Kar'Dan's Seat|Ironforged]] dramatically. These outside magi are a source of internal strife, as they represent a power base not tied to the elemental planes. At the moment, they are content to follow the Elemental Lords, that is certain to not last for long.
### Culture

The culture of Minabald is dominated by the Elemental Courts. Each Court lays claim to different parts of the city, and is allowed to set laws and custom within their territory. This authority even partially extends into the laws of reality itself. Within the Fire District, passions run hot and cannot be contained. Within the Air District, gravity itself becomes more of a suggestion as even wingless beings are able to jump immense distances. The Earth District feels more real than reality, and no lie may be spoken within its borders - a fact of magic, not a law that may be broken. The Water district extends below the waves, but all may breathe freely there, and no fire may be lit. Recently, Metal and Wood Districts have been established, but their Lords have far weaker control over the city than their established brethren.

The other facts weighing on every mind are the recent arrival of [[Crystal Order|non-elemental mages]] and their escalating conflict with the [[Kar'Dan's Seat|Ironforged]]. Minabald itself has seldom bothered with the desert as a whole, but that has changed with the discovery of [[mana crystals]] and the settlement of the orcs. While conflict has so far been large confined to skirmishes and border fighting, it is only a matter of time before true war erupts.

### Government

Minabald is governed by representatives of the four Elemental Courts. These representatives are powerful Geniekin, hand-picked by the lords of the Elemental Planes. Their small number and even divisions frequently result in deadlock, as three must agree to make a change to the laws of Minabald. As a result, the laws of the Districts are the only laws that apply to most matters.

There is a small area of Minabald that is governed by the Council directly, being under the control of no single Court. This land contains the Council chambers, a single dock, and a boulevard in the middle of the city. Beyond that, all land in the city and much of its surrounding area is claimed by a Court. For most matters, Minabald has four governments, not one.

### Religion

[[The Elemental Lords]] are the focus of religion in Minabald. Unlike other religions, followers of the Lords have a direct and personal relationship with the elementals they worship. While everyone pays respect to the greatest of the Lords, even minor elementals form contracts with mortals in exchange for worship and service. 

These contracts are the basis of daily religious practice for followers of the elements. An earth elemental may be contracted to protect a home from invaders, and paid in tribute and worship rites. These rites and offerings empower the elementals that receive them, becoming wealth and power on the elemental planes.

### Military

The city of Minabald is well guarded against invaders by the mighty elementals who dwell there, and no serious threat has attacked it in living memory. The outlying villages are less well guarded, but many have a patron elemental that serves as its protector. In terms of mortal armies, each District maintains a military force to protect their interests outside the city. They tend to reflect that element's nature - Water has a mighty navy that protects trade, Earth has mighty heavy infantry, Fire has gunpowder weapons, and Air focuses on light skirmishing infantry.

The [[Crystal Order]] has its own armed forces as well. They are a highly mobile force, striking out when mana crystals are ready for harvest and claiming them, then withdrawing to the safety of Minabald. When these raids come across [[Kar'Dan's Seat|Ironforged]] forces, battle ensues. The Crystal Order provides overwhelming magical support, offsetting their weaker infantry against the orcs.

### Names

Minabald names are drawn from the elemental languages, and so do not have a fixed theme. Players may wish to draw names of Djinn or Faeries from folklore. Surname are typically elemental, or refer to an elemental process or material.
