Thaxhold is the largest Dwarven state, and is frequently considered a senior partner to [[Ravidhold]]. Thaxhold is the religious heart of the worship of The High Gods, and is the location of the [[Mirror of Stars]]. Thaxhold is known for its magical crafts, with even their mundane goods frequently having some minor enchantment or similar feature.

### History

Thaxhold is the oldest continuously settled site on [[Lendis]], with a history stretching back 5,000 years. [[Thax]], who would become the first High King, led his people into the [[Worldbirth Mountains]]. Here, where the world was first formed, he meditated to seek wisdom. Gazing into the Mirror of Stars, a perfectly still shallow pool of water high in the mountains, he saw the truth of the Stars reflected in its water. Each is a god, dwelling in a perfect jewel. By searching for this world’s perfect jewel, his people could tap into that power and achieve greatness.  

Slowly, over the generations, the dwarves of Thaxhold dug into the mountains, settling deep underground. They mastered the art of mining for gems, and learned to place enchantments within them. Above ground, the human settlements of the [[Riverlands]] would rise and fall in a petty cycle of raiding and war, but below the Thax Dynasty ruled unchallenged.

The long history of Thaxhold began to shift two hundred years ago, when the Riverfolk first began transitioning from raiders to traders. With the potential for large new markets for their goods, the crafting guilds began to accumulate additional power. After millennia of absolute rule, the High Kings found themselves checked for the first time. This greatly accelerated when[[ Frilga Deyonter]] became Queen of [[Marksgrav]], and signed an official alliance with Thaxhold as its primary trade partner.

### Culture

Thaxhold has a long history of magical crafts, especially minor enchantments that are commonplace throughout the land. Magical lights illuminate the underground holds, and simple enchantments make life comfortable and convenient. This has created a society comfortable with living on the bleeding edge of magical progress, with new innovations coming every generation.

As a curious balance to this societal obsession with pushing the boundaries of enchantment and magical artifice, the social structures of Thaxhold are very conservative. It is only very recently that the High King has had any checks on his or her power, and even with the surge in the power of the crafting guilds they seem uncomfortable openly defying the High King. There is a sense, however, that everything is about to change. Now that the first cracks have appeared in the High King’s authority, the younger generations are pushing for more power to be handed over to the guilds.

### Government

Thaxhold is ruled by a High King (Currently High King [[Thax XXI]]), who styles himself the symbolic ruler of all Dwarfdom (a view other Holds do not necessarily agree with). However, his authority is limited in practice by a council of elder craftsmen responsible for implementing his decrees. Any decisions that are strongly opposed by the council tend to be stuck in committee debating specific details indefinitely.

Thaxhold is the capital city of a number of smaller holds and villages across the Western Worldbirth Mountains. Each hold has a King that rules their hold in a smaller scale mirror of the High King and his court. The King of a hold has absolute authority, except where overruled by the High King. Similarly, the smaller villages have an Overseer who governs the village except where overruled by the King of the nearest hold. Despite the title, both men and women can become King or High King.

### Religion

Thaxhold’s state religion is [[the High Gods]]. The religion was founded by the first High King [[Thax]], and the [[Mirror of Stars]] is a holy site revered by all members of the faith. The High King, Kings, and Overseers are all advised by a number of astronomer-priests, who measure the movement of the stars to see what wisdom the High Gods wish to impart. While lacking official authority to rule, these priests have significant influence on the daily lives of the people of Thaxhold, and are frequently consulted even by the common people regarding important decisions.

To enable the stargazing required by their religion, the people of Thaxhold have built a number of spires that stretch up from the top of the mountains that contain their holds. These spires are used both for direct observation from platforms at the top as well as for reflecting starlight underground using an intricate network of mirrors.

### Military

Thaxhold’s military is divided into two major branches. The Wardens are intended to fight underground against Nightmare pockets and bandits attempting to prey on the routes between Thaxhold and its subsidiary holds and villages. Wardens typically operate in mixed units of polearms and crossbows, taking advantage of the low ceilings and narrow halls common to subterranean battlefields.

By comparison, the Star Guard are heavy soldiers intended to guard the surface trade routes with Marksgrav and its allies. Armed with deadly hammers and axes and equipped with heavy armor, the Star Guard provide an anchor for their Riverfolk allies to work around during joint battles. The Star Guard has a smaller contingent of marines with lighter armor and weapons meant to accompany Marksgrav’s merchant ships.

Thaxhold has not adopted firearms, preferring their magical arms and armor over the unreliable new technology. Thaxhold magic users typically serve in support or civilian roles, rather than being battlefield evokers. Thaxhold’s wealth and enchanting mastery is evident in war through their widespread use of runic weapons and armor.

### Names

Like many dwarven countries, places in Thaxhold are named after their founder. A settlement of more than a thousand people is typically called a Hold, with less than that being called a Village. So a Village founded by Durik would be Durik Village, and if it grows large enough it would be Durikhold.

Thaxholder names tend to be short, with masculine names ending with a consonant sound and feminine names ending with a vowel sound. Surnames are based on the parent's name, with sons named for their mother and daughters named for their father. (So Durik's daughter Jule would be called Jule Duriksdottir, and her son Clarz would be called Clarz Juleson)

**Example masculine names** Durik, Maled, Lorix, Yalen, Grut, Walt, Porig, Ennan, Clarz, Karum

**Example feminine names** Dora, Lendu, Rego, Jule, Fresti, Mola, Hago, Bristi, Cerou, Zande
