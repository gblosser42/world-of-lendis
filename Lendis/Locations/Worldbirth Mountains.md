The Worldbirth Mountains are a frozen mountainous region along the Southern coast of [[Lendis]]. It is split into two branches by the ocean, but the Dwarves who live there consider it a single mountain range. The Western half of the mountains is home to [[Thaxhold]], the most powerful Dwarven nation in the world. The Eastern half contains [[Ravidhold]], a rival state to Thaxhold that perpetually lives in its shadow.

The people of the Worldbirth Mountains are known for their magical crafts and knowledge, being the foremost enchanters in the world.
