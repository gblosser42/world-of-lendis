Drakhold is the last dwarven holdout in the [[Drakwald Mountains]]. Between underground incursions from the [[Forest of Night]] and wars with the [[giant]] clans and other native monsters, the hold has been in a slow decline. Drakholders possess a dark fatalism, an unspoken knowledge that they will inevitably fail and see their culture extinguished. But they are willing to fight against that end, and never give up struggling.

### History

The Drakhold Empire once spanned the entire [[Drakwald Mountains]]. At its height, it boasted millions of dwarves across dozens of major holds. But over time, it has weakened due to the unrelenting danger of the [[Forest of Night]]. Step by step, Drakhold was pushed back. For centuries, Drakhold was the primary target for [[Scourge|Scourges]], leaving barely enough time to rebuild before another threat arose.

Things came to a dire head 400 years ago. The Scourge known as [[The First Titan]] lead a brutal assault on Drakhold's surface villages, followed by a powerful ritual that created a series of devastating earthquakes throughout the mountain range. In the chaos that followed, the Titan systematically crushed the outlying fortresses that supported and protected Drakhold's heartland. While it was eventually defeated, this marked the beginning of the end for Drakhold. The following centuries would see a series of costly victories and defeats that were impossible to recover from.

### Culture

Drakholders are living out the final days of their culture, and all of them know it. Before the Titan's onslaught, Drakhold was the most powerful Dwarven state in the world, a force that rivaled even the [[Dragon Empire]]. Now, they are doomed. But while they know that they face the end, they refuse to go quietly. Drakhold and all of its people are prepared to make [[the Nightmare]] pay dearly for every inch, and will throw everything into surviving one more day.

The streets and buildings of Drakhold are built as a fortress. Every home has a stash of weapons, and has been updated with an eye towards firing lines and defending key points. This siege mentality extends to their everyday life as well. Drakholders tend to be very communal, helping each other without expecting repayment. If any of them falls, the end is one step closer.

### Government

Drakhold is run by a council of priests, each speaking for one of the [[Made Gods]]. The priests vote on matters, with a simple majority sufficing in most cases. The priest of [[The Made Gods|The Herald Of The End]] traditionally refrains from voting, but has veto power over the decisions of the rest of the council - a privilege rarely used. The council is a relatively recent development, having gained power steadily over the past few hundred years while supplanting the old monarchy.

Outside of the council, the military has absolute authority to give orders to civilians when they deem it necessary, from demanding supplies to conscripting militia to repurposing buildings. Any civilian who believes this authority was abused may petition the council for redress after the fact, but is still expected to obey in the moment.

### Religion

Religion is central to life in Drakhold, to the extent that their government is run by priests. The citizens pray to [[The Made Gods]] for help, guidance, protection, and any other matters they wish for divine intervention in. Parents pray to the Mother of All for safe childbirth, soldiers to the Guardian of the Hearth for courage in battle, or to the Thief of Stars for a successful business deal. They curse in the names of the Traitor of Hope or the Butcher of Life. And in the central hall of Drakhold, overlooking the plazas and markets at the heart of the city, the great statues keep eternal watch.

The fatalism of Drakhold finds a release through religion. When the Herald of the End is found, the world will be unmade and a new world will be created. If Drakhold can endure until the Herald rises, they may be able to have a presence or influence on this new world. Yet it is prophecized that the Herald of the End will not be discovered until the other thirteen are known. For this reason, the [[Searchers for Truth]] comb the world for any sign or portent of the missing Gods.

### Military

The military of Drakhold is entirely organized around the defense of the Hold. They have no offensive branches who pursue empire or raid other states. Instead, the three branches revolve around their training and how they are used.

[[The Scouts]] are lightly armed and armored. They garrison a series of light expendable forts in the mountains and along the edges of the [[Forest|Forest of Night]], and are trained for speed above all else. Their duty is to inform Drakhold the moment any threat arises, not to face it directly.

[[The Guards]] are the main body of the military, trained to defend the narrow halls and passages of the mountain hold. They tend towards heavy infantry, armed with shields and breaching pikes. They fight in tight ranks, using the reach of their pikes to keep enemies at bay.

Finally, every fit adult is a member of [[The Militia|the Militia]]. The Militia are typically armed with shortbows or crossbows, and are the primary ranged support for the Guard. Everyone is expected to train at least once a month, and the fortifications within Drakhold itself allow these ranged combatants to harry invaders while the Guards mount firm resistance.

In addition to these formal branches, Drakholders are willing to try anything to stave off the Nightmare. Spellcasters of every type fight side by side with martial soldiers, and the engineers of Drakhold deploy experimental gunpowder weapons.

### Names

Long ago, Drakholders used surnames that reflected parentage or craft. However, during the decline and the slow encroachment of [[the Nightmare]], more and more began to simply take the surname "Of Drakhold". They view it as a sign of solidarity, declaring themselves one family who will live or die together.
