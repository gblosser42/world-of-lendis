Dawn keep is a joint military keep operated by [[Ravidhold]] and various [[Riverfolk]] groups. Its purpose is to keep a watch on the [[Forest of Night]] to the north, and ensure that none of the monsters within threaten the lands without. Dawn Keep has magical lines of communication to nearby cities, in case it becomes beset by an enemy too numerous or powerful to handle.

Dawn Keep is supported by a network of nearby villages and minor towns, from which it can draw a larger militia if needed. It is governed by a military commander, who possesses the unique Dawn General rank whose authority is recognized by all of the states who operate the keep. The current Dawn General is a dwarf named [[Volkmir Ironhand]]. While not especially old for a dwarf, Volkmir has served in the post for ten years - a long time given the high casualty rate associated with guarding against the Forest.

Dawn Keep is the most notable fort keeping watch on the Forest of Night's southern border, but is not the only one. A line of smaller watchtowers, fortified towns, and military keeps dot the fifty mile border, each within sight of one or two others in any direction. While run and operated by different people or groups, these forts know that should any of them fail, the rest will likely follow. As a result, they are always willing to lend aid or supplies should another fort be attacked or grow weak. A similar network exists on the northern border.

The people who live in these forts - as well as the villages that support them - have a shared sense of cultural identity. While nowhere is entirely safe from Nightmares, most villages see Nightmare attacks once a generation at most. but the Watchers of Night are perpetually under siege, and must be constantly alert against death and disaster. Few reach adulthood without losing a friend or family member, and even fewer die of old age.

When a [[The Nightmare|Nightmare]] [[Scourge]] arises, the forts brace for the inevitable while the villages evacuate. Most of the forts will fall and be overrun, buying time for the nations at their back to organize a large scale counterattack. When the Scourge is defeated, the refugees return and rebuild for the next attack.
