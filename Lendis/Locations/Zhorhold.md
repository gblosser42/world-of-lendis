In the Stoneheart Mountains in southern [[Allerai]] is Zhorhold, a dwarven nation with a strong religious and contemplative attitude. Unlike the enchanters of the [[Worldbirth Mountains]], the dwarves of Zhorhold eschew magic in favor of traditional and time-honed skills. The metal and stone of the Stoneheart Mountains are the highest quality in the world, and the artisan-masters of Zhorhold are in high demand.

### History

Zhorhold was originally founded 2,000 years ago by hardcore traditionalists unsatisfied with the growing role of magic in [[Thaxhold]] society. They moved north, and settled the Stoneheart Mountains. Here, they delved the deep stone and were changed by what they found. In the darkest reaches below the Stoneheart Mountains, the world began to whisper to them. Over time, they would abandon [[The High Gods]] in favor of [[The Living Stone]].

The Stone told the delving dwarves where to find the purest ores and the finest stone. It warned of natural disasters in time to evacuate or prevent them. It whispered who could be trusted, and who spoke lies. Following the word of The Stone, the dwarves of Zhorhold established a prosperous and stable society.

The dwarves of Zhorhold would selectively ally with the most trustworthy groups among the humans who lived in the lowlands of [[Allerai]]. Over time, this support would lead those groups to forming the Kingdom of [[Lorin]]. Lorin and Zhorhold would enjoy strong relations throughout their history, which lead to Zhorhold taking in many refugees from the recent revolution.

### Culture

Zhorhold highly values individual skill and craftsmanship. The artisans of Zhorhold are among the best in the world, and their products are enhanced by the unnaturally high quality of their raw materials. Magical crafts are not exactly outlawed, but are looked upon as a cheap imitation of true skill.

Zhorholders take a dim view towards the dwarves of the [[Worldbirth Mountains]], viewing them as deviant heathens, who look in the wrong direction for truth. Their attitude towards the other races are more positive, if tinged by a superiority complex. Humans cannot be expected to hear The Stone, or spend decades perfecting a craft, after all. As such, they are afforded more leniency, and viewed like a fond - if foolish - nephew.

### Government

Zhorhold is ruled by a monarch, but rather than being hereditary the monarch is elected upon the death of the previous ruler. The greatest craftsmen are eligible to be chosen, and any Master of a craft may cast a vote. The current ruler of Zhorhold is Craft-Queen [[Phylli Brassfoot]], a peerless crafter of jewelry and carver of precious stones. She has been further strengthening Zhorhold's ties with [[Lorin]], taking advantage of the turmoil to broker new trade agreements that favor her people.

The Council of Masters advises her, but does not hold any direct government authority. It is a self-policing body where anybody recognized as a Master of a craft by an existing Master gains membership. In practice, the Council handles many day-to-day affairs such as customs inspections and setting standards of quality and behavior for craftsmen. While the Craft-Queen could overrule them, she rarely does.

### Religion

Zhorhold's state religion is [[The Living Stone]], and the Stone's word shapes every aspect of life. Priests who can hear the Stone's whispers offer advice on everything from choosing a career, to trade deals, to relationships. The Stone seems to genuinely care for the mortal dwarves who dwell within it, most of its advice is sound.

There has been a rise in religious tension in the past few years, however. Refugees from [[Lorin]] have brought with them worship of [[The Heavenly Choir]], a fact that displeases the traditionalists of Zhorhold. Craft-Queen [[Phylli Brassfoot|Brassfoot]] has refused calls to ban its worship outright, but pressure is growing and she will be forced to act to prevent civil unrest soon.

### Military

Zhorhold's military is small, largely intended to keep [[The Nightmare|Nightmares]] under control and deter outside invasion. Zhorhold's unique stoneworking has resulted in unique heavy infantry who wear stone armor. They are typically armed with heavy melee weapons, taking advantage of the short sight-lines in their underground holds to overwhelm would-be invaders.

Zhorholder militia typically are lightly armored, and use repurposed mining equipment such as picks and hammers. They can be quickly raised in response to a Nightmare incursion, and are rarely used in war with other mortal groups.

### Names

Like many dwarven countries, places in Zhorhold are named after their founder. A settlement of more than a thousand people is typically called a Hold, with less than that being called a Village. So a Village founded by Durik would be Durik Village, and if it grows large enough it would be Durikhold.

Some Zhorholder names are still carry-overs from their Thaxhold origins. However, most Zhorholders are named for types of stone or gems, with surnames typically being derived from metals. Igneous and Sedimentary rocks are typically viewed as appropriate masculine names, while Metamorphic rocks and gemstones are more common for feminine names.
