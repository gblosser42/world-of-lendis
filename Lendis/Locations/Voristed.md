Voristed is a rival city to [[Marksgrav]]. The people of Voristead lean into the martial nature common to [[Riverfolk]], seeing value largely in strength and conquest. They have long desired to conquer Marksgrav and secure their dominance over the [[Riverlands]], but Marksgravâ€™s alliance with the Dwarves of [[Thaxhold]] has made that a difficult proposition.

### History

Like [[Marksgrav]], Voristed has its roots in the violent and unstable history of the [[Riverlands]]. It was originally a meeting place, a neutral ground for the leaders of various [[Riverfolk]] tribes and warbands to gather in peace to negotiate or accept surrender. Over time, a town grew up around this meeting ground, and Voristed was born. Being one of the few places in the Riverlands where violence was forbidden, Voristed attracted those weary of war and struggle.

But like everything else in the Riverlands, this would not last. As time passed and more people settled in Voristed, the taboo against violence began to weaken. Conflicts between Voristeders gave rise to a peacekeeping force, and the growing number of people attracted more nightmares which had to be repelled. In the end, Voristed was doomed to become little more than just another town of warriors fighting for survival.

### Culture

One remaining artifact of Voristed's time as a neutral meeting ground is the high value Voristeders place on offers of hospitality. While violence itself is no longer outlawed, a Voristeder would rather die than harm one they have guaranteed safe passage or lodging to. This even extends to battle, with prisoners taken after surrendering being treated well and ransomed or released in short order.  

Voristeders enjoy competition. While martial contests are the most highly regarded, Voristeders will eagerly compete in anything they can. Outsiders are often baffled by the intensity with which Voristeders will engage in painting contests, play board games, engage in aggressive poetry, or even dance. All of these endeavors are seen as practice and prelude to the main focus: duels and mock battles. The arenas of Voristed can host battles between dozens or even hundreds of contestants. While these battles are intended to be nonlethal, accidents and injuries do happen.

### Government

This obsession with competition extends to the Voristed government. Voristed is ruled by a [[Triumvirate]] of warriors, who determine their successor by the result of a duel. Any decree that two of the Triumvirate agree on becomes law, and any member of the Triumvirate may challenge another to force their compliance. Membership in the Triumverate is for life, although not always for long. Any citizen of Voristed can challenge one of the Triumverate to a duel for their position. These duels are always to the death, and can be fought with any weapon - including magic. Should a member of the Triumverate die outside of a replacement duel, a tournament will be held to fill their place. In an emergency situation, the surviving members can instead simply name a replacement they agree upon. When that happens, an official tournament must be held to name a permanent replacement within a year of the emergency ending.

The legal status of duels extends into daily life as well. Should people have a dispute or wish to enforce compliance with an agreement, they are expected to fight. These duels are not allowed to be lethal, and many less-martial citizens arrange for other contests instead of a direct fight. Killing somebody in a duel can result in a wide range of punishments, from a fine to whipping to even death.

### Religion

Voristed holds to the old faith of the [[Riverlands]],[[ the Unknown Gods]]. Their zeal for their faith is a driving factor of their obsession with competition. Only someone who is as close to godhood as a mortal can become will be worthy of discovering the True Gods. This fact is self-evident to any true believer.

The priests of Voristed more closely resemble guidance councilors or personal trainers than meditative scholars. Each citizen of Voristed is expected to persue their own perfection, along the metrics that they have chosen. The priests speak with their flock in order to understand what each individual considers godly, what traits they wish to cultivate. And then the priest pushes that individual to pursue that ideal.

### Military

Voristed wishes to become the center of a grand empire in the [[Riverlands]], and views [[Marksgrav]] as their greatest obstacle to doing so. However, the alliance between Marksgrav and [[Thaxhold]] makes them a nonviable target - at least for now. Voristed is focusing on uniting the smaller tribes and towns in the Eastern Riverlands, frequently by force. As their numbers and power grows, they are preparing to move West, and take on their rivals directly.

In the interim, Voristed and Marksgrav are engaged in endemic low-scale border wars and raiding. While cavalry forces have a difficult time moving in the Riverlands, light infantry and naval raiders are a key compoent to border raids. Voristed raiders are typically armed with light armor, a round shield, a longsword, and a shortbow. These raiding bands tend to be small, less than a hundred strong, but larger forces can be put together if a particularly tempting target presents itself.

For conquering their neighbord, Voristed favors a heavier approach. Their elite heavy infantry wears scale armor, and is armed with falcatas and javelins to maximize close range lethality. The superior numbers and training of Voristed's army allows it to easily crush smaller towns. Voristed disdains the use of firearms, believing the new technology requires no skill to use and is as likely to harm its wielder as the target.

### Names

Voristeders use relatively few names, with most children being named for a parent or grandparent. Family names are based on boastful titles of the greatest deed of their ancestors. Should an individual surpass the deed mentioned in their family name, they will break off to form a new family named for their latest triumph. Some rare individuals even change surnames multiple times as they surpass their previous deeds again and again.
