A generation ago, Lorin was a mighty kingdom. Its ships contested the Panthar, and its armies kept control over everything north of the [[Riverlands|Rivers]] and south of the [[Tempest Desert|Desert]]. But following a series of disasters, the government of Lorin was devastated enough that the populace began trying to implement a new idea: rule by the people.

### History

The Kingdom of Lorin was founded about 900 years ago, when one of the human clans warring for control over [[Allerai]] established an alliance with the dwarves of [[Zhorhold]]. This clan, lead by [[King Medavan]] and later his heirs, would consolidate control of the region through a series of expansion wars that raged on and off for 70 years. At the end of it, The Kingdom of Lorin stood unchallenged.

The following centuries saw Lorin's power rise. They became a great maritime power, and established trade through both the Riverlands and the Tempest Desert. In the past 30 years, however, this greatness has come tumbling down. The [[Agony Plague]] ravaged Lorin, killing highborn and low alike. In the end, it even claimed the life of [[King Laramel]], who died without living heirs. As a result, the aristocracy fell into a succession war. On and on the war dragged, long past the point when the original claimants were dead. At the end, there was no victor to sit on the throne, and most of the noble houses had been destroyed. With the nobility nearly destroyed, the people of Lorin began the transition to democracy.

### Culture

Lorin is undergoing a massive cultural shift, as it abandons monarchy in favor of democracy. This process is messy, with entirely new ideas being tried with no way of knowing what will or will not work. Reflecting this chaotic situation, fashions and behaviors have become much more fast moving as well. One thing that has remained relatively constant, however, is revolutionary fervor. People suspected of loyalty to the old regime are shunned or worse, save for the holdouts in Baalhas.

Amid all of this, life is unstable. The plague, succession war, and reforms have left the military weak or absent. [[The Nightmare|Nightmare]] events are not addressed promptly, leading to travel becoming increasingly dangerous. Those who are not trying to capitalize on the chaos are keeping their heads down and focusing on survival. Many adventurers have flocked to Lorin, offering their skills until the government can stabilize.

### Government

Lorin's new government is a representational democracy based around [[The Assembly]] in Lorinhas, its capital city. Every adult citizen of Lorin is permitted one vote, but that vote may be transferred to others. Those who hold people's votes travel to The Assembly, and cast their collected votes. There is currently a scramble to hold an official census, to prevent people from casting votes for citizens that don't actually exist. There is additionally great debate about how to verify that a person actually was given the transferred votes they claim.

Within The Assembly, a 2/3 majority is required to enact any legislation. As more towns and villages send representatives with their votes, the number of votes cast at each session balloons rapidly. This results in laws being enacted and overturned, only to be re-enacted again. The last Assembly meeting saw just over 2 million votes cast, and estimates for the number of adult citizens ranges from 3 to 5 million. This question is complicated by debate over who counts as a "citizen" and if everyone should be permitted to vote.

### Religion

Lorin's dominant religion is [[The Heavenly Choir]], which holds that the world was sung into existence by a great host of divinities. Song and music are highly valued, and many speeches on The Assembly's floor are given by singing. With the collapse of the aristocracy, many have turned to the church for leadership. 

The [[Church of the Heavenly Choir is]] lead by High Singer [[Zekilan]], who is trying to carefully guide the church through these tumultuous times without becoming the next target of revolutionary fervor. Her critics within the Church claim she is letting a golden opportunity pass by, a chance for the Church to become the de facto power in Lorin.

### Military

Lorin's military is greatly weakened from its peak strength due to the plague and succession war. What is left is largely divided into two categories: local armies and the [[Republican Army]].
Most towns have a local militia, designed to protect against bandits and raiders and handle basic [[The Nightmare|Nightmare]] incursions. They tend to be equipped with basic polearms and muskets with at most light armor.

The Republican Army is better trained and equipped, and is operated out of [[Lorinhas]]. It is engaged with fending off incursions from the [[Dragon Empire]] and crushing any royalist uprisings attempting to destroy the new government. Most of the state's cavalry affiliated with the nobility, and was all but destroyed in the succession war. As a result, the Republican Army is mostly infantry, equipped with a mixture of pikes and muskets. The government is experimenting with field artillery using gunpowder, but lacks the centralized industrial capacity to do so in great number yet.

### Names

The most prominent feature of Lorin names is alternating vowel and consonant sounds. Names are typically genderless, with no masculine/feminine differences. Lorin surnames are typically based on musical terms, although some Zhorholder surnames are also common.
