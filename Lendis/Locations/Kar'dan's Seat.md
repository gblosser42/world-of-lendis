Orcs have long suffered as outsiders in the world. Driven from their lands, slaughtered as monsters, and looked down upon as savage barbarians, they have slowly but surely been forced into the desert - the last place that will have them. And even here, the recent expansion of Minabald has seen the “civilized” nations cast their lot against the orcs once more. But they have been forged in iron, and they will not break. They will not give up their final home.

### History

Orcs have been outsiders for their entire existence. For most of their history, the other races have considered them [[The Nightmare|Nightmares]] or at least Nightmare-twisted. As such, they have been driven out, hunted and killed over the course of a long and bloody history. Any time the orcs would try to rise up or band together, a war would soon result to drive them back down. They were not considered people, and so could be enslaved or killed without regard for law.

Forty years ago, a young orc leader named [[Iron General Makrag|Makrag]] lead a band of orcs into the Tempest Desert. There, he found the ruins of an ancient orc civilization, long since lost to the desert. Few of the relics found there were still intact, and fewer still could be understood. Yet among all of the ruin there stood a perfectly intact throne carved into the side of a mountain, engraved with the name "Kar'dan" across the top arch. Makrag declared that the orcs would rebuild their lost glory, and would establish a safe haven for their kind. In doing so, Kar'Dan's Seat was founded, the first orc city in generations.

Makrag made contact with other groups of orcs, slowly bringing them to Kar'dan's Seat. Over the next twenty years, the orcs managed to build a true home for themselves - although the inhospitable desert made life hard. These orcs called themselves Ironforged, strengthened by the trials they faced to get here, and swore they would not allow themselves to be cast out of this final refuge. For those twenty years, it seemed the rest of the world would let them. Then, [[mana crystals]] were discovered in the desert. Suddenly, an influx of settlers from [[Minabald]], including a new [[Crystal Order|order]] of mages bent on studying the crystals, began to enter the desert. They quickly came into contact with the orcs, and tried to drive them out once more. But this time, the Ironforged may be strong enough to fight back.

### Culture

Kar'dan's seat exists on perpetual war footing. Every step back, every lost battle, every abandoned village is seen as a step on the road to extinction, and so the Ironforged do everything they can to avoid those steps. Those who are not soldiers are dedicated to gathering materials and shaping them into the tools needed to wage this final war. It is a society of warriors, with even smiths and farmers seeing themselves as part of the army. Indeed, anyone who contributes at all to the war effort - which is nearly everyone - is given a rank within the military.

Yet there also exists a small band of orcs who do not fight. They are tasked with studying art and scholarship, as well as excavating the ruins Kar'Dan's seat was built upon. They are fiercely protected by the warriors, and are seen as the hope of the future. One day, when the war is won and the other races have given up trying to kill them, the orcs will need these Dreamers to restore what makes life worth living.

### Government

The Ironforged exist on constant war footing. Commanders and generals hold as much civic sway as princes and kings do elsewhere. The ultimate ruler of the Ironforged is [[Iron General Makrag]], a powerful warrior who led the orcs into the desert in his youth. Yet even Makrag does not rule alone. A council of advisors and officers have his ear, and together they create battle plans and operations to protect themselves against [[Minabald|Minabald's]] incursions. Additionally, this council has a single Dreamer representative on it, who has absolute veto power over Makrag's decisions should they threaten the soul of the orcish people.

Civil law does not exist in Kar'dan's seat, although several Dreamers are trying to write a corpus of laws that can be implemented when peace is won. Instead, all crimes are tried as a military tribunal, and punishment is determined by the degree to which the offense hampered the war effort. Crimes against orcs by outsiders are judged especially harshly, as it is seen as an invasion by the outside world.

### Religion

The old gods have failed the orcs, and have been long since abandoned during the endless exile and suffering they faced. Many orcs have since reached the conclusion that the gods of the world have sided against them, and so return the favor. These orcs worship nothing and nobody, and will seize the future on their own terms.

The other approach is to study the faiths of their oppressors, and try to find strength there. These orcs have syncretized a collection of religions from other cultures, into a mixture that suits their needs. The most popular is a mixture of [[The High Gods]] and [[The Heavenly Choir]], seeing the stars as a source of music and hope. The only faith not respected here is the [[Elemental Lords]], who are seen as a real and present enemy.

### Military

Ironforged favor heavy infantry and thrown weapons, using their superior strength and endurance to their advantage. Despite the desert's heat, the orcs experience little difficulty even wearing heavy metal armor. Two handed weapons are especially common, with the soldiers relying on their heavy armor for protection rather than shields. The heavy Harmona Gun is seeing increasingly common usage as well, as the mining and forging operations in the Drakwald Mountains become more developed.

The primary enemy of Kar'dan's Seat is [[Minabald]], especially the [[Crystal Order]]. They seek to drive the orcs from the desert so that they may easily harvest the [[mana crystals]] that grow there. These engagements tend to be determined by who gets the element of surprise, as Minabald's superior magic allows them to overwhelm the Ironforged in pitched battle, but falls quickly to a blitz attack.

### Names

Orcs take no surnames, each individual's identity standing on its own. Children are typically raised communally, and orcs frequently have relationships with multiple partners over the course of their lives. This mentality also creates a sense of shared ownership among the Ironforged, with personal property being very loosely considered compared to other cultures. Their names are two syllables long, with masculine names emphasizing the first syllable and feminine names emphasizing the second. The names themselves are identical, only pronunciation varies.
