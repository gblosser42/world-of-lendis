Ravidhold lives in [[Thaxhold]]’s shadow. To many, Ravidhold can be summarized as “Like Thaxhold, but less”, a characterization that Ravidholders strive against. While Ravidhold’s magical crafts are not as well developed as Thaxhold’s, and they lack the easy access to overseas markets that [[Marksgrav]] provides to Thaxhold, the people of Ravidhold are ambitious and eager to make a name for themselves.

### History

While the area that would become Ravidhold has been settled on and off for millenia, Ravidhold's history dates back 2,500 years. Originally a colony of [[Thaxhold]], Ravidhold declared its independence after generations of neglect from the distant [[High King]]. The people of Thaxhold suddenly discovered they had a great deal of interest in their near-forgotten colony, and waged a war to preserve their rule. Unable to effectively project power to maintain control, Thaxhold officially recognized Ravidhold's sovereignty 2,000 years ago.  

Since then, Ravidhold has fought to emerge from Thaxhold's shadow. Ravidhold has laid claim to three empires stretching into the [[Riverlands]] in that time. Despite its military skill, the Ravidholders have been unable to hold onto their conquests for long. But Ravidhold is on the rise again, and once more dreams of empire.

### Culture

While possessing the same unique crafts and magical style as other dwarves of the [[Worldbirth Mountains]], Ravidholders are much more likely to find military applications for those crafts. Ravidhold's culture has, in many ways, been defined in opposition to [[Thaxhold]]. Where Thaxhold has begun to establish trade relations in the [[Riverlands]], Ravidhold seeks to conquer. Where Thaxholders value crafts that make life easier, Ravidholders have a nearly ostentatious level of discipline and spartan living.

Taken on their own merits, Ravidhold is a militarized society. Military service is highly regarded, and only those who have served in the military are allowed to own land. Underneath that layer, however, is a thriving civilian sector. While legally renting their land and property from military landlords, they nonetheless have extensive wealth and unofficial social power. Some of these tradesmen are straining against military rule, and rumors of rebellion have begun to circulate.

### Government

Ravidhold is ruled by a King with much more absolute power than the [[High King]] in Thaxhold. The current King, King [[Rurik II]], wishes to expand Ravidhold's control. In addition to the usual excursions into the [[Riverlands]], he has also been preparing for a long range expedition to reinforce [[Drakhold]] and bring it under the control of Ravidhold.

The King's word is law, and that law is carried out by his military subordinates. Officially, the entire government is organized like a military. At the top is the War Council, with the highest ranking officers. Below them are the Commanders of various units and settlements. Below them are the Captains, the lowest ranking officers. Despite these titles, however, many of the officers are more civilian than military, putting in a token term of service before focusing on their specializations in administration. Ravidhold's officer corps fills the same social role that nobility do in other cultures, and most posts are de facto hereditary.

### Religion

Ravidhold respects [[the High Gods]], similar to [[Thaxhold]]. While the [[Mirror of Stars]] is sacred to Ravidholders, they do not recognize the spiritual authority of Thaxhold's [[High King]]. Instead, Ravidhold's religious practices are more decentralized, with each officer having a priest advisor skilled at reading the stars.

Ravidhold, and most of the holds under its control, is built around a large central plaza with a direct opening above it. Either dug through the mountain to reach the surface or discovered after naturally forming, these tunnels allow the dwarves to see the sky and the stars, and have some hardy surface plants that grow in them.

### Military

Ravidhold's military is divided into four branches, each with a leader on the War Council. The [[Home Guard]] are the garrison and lawkeeping forces, largely focused on enforcing military rule and protecting the holds and villages from raiders and nightmares. They typically wear mail armor with shields and spiked clubs. Their clubs are intended to instill fear in potential malcontents, leaving them alive but crippled and in great pain. When fighting against other armed forces, they typically switch out the clubs for spears and shortbows. The [[Surface Legion]] is Ravidhold's offensive forces, intended to conquer and occupy the [[Riverlands]]. They are a mixture of medium and heavy infantry, armed with pikes, short swords, and shortbows. They have a small cavalry force, although most dwarves are more comfortable fighting on foot. The [[Starguard]] are Ravidhold's militant spellcasters. Serving as battlefield artillery, they provide heavy ranged firepower when needed, and are typically attached out to one of the other branches rather than operating on their own. Finally, the newest branch is the [[Powder Corps]], an experiment in large scale gunpowder weapons. They mostly specialize in cannon and sapping, using masterful dwarven engineering to construct larger bombards. Personal scale firearms are used scarcely, due to the powder being dangerous to use in tight quarters.

While Ravidhold's society is organized around their military, their actual record in warfare is mixed at best. Due to mixing civilian administrative positions with military officer ranks, their armies are often lead by political appointments with little combat skill rather than experienced veterans. Additionally, infighting among the armed branches weakens their ability to coordinate and wage large scale war.

### Names

Ravidhold has similar names to [[Thaxhold]], due to their shared cultural history. Places are named after their founder, and given names tend to be short - no more than two syllables. Unlike in Thaxhold, however, Ravidholders use set family names passed down the paternal line. Many of these family names are similar to Thaxhold's parental names, but they no longer change with each generation. Some families have taken distinct names to set themselves apart from Thaxhold more. These names tend to be boastful descriptors or simple job titles.
