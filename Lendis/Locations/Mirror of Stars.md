The Mirror of Stars is a perfectly still pool of water high in the [[Worldbirth Mountains]] that neither wind nor touch can disturb. It always reflects the heavens above, even in the brightest day. It was by gazing into this pool that High King [[Thax]] came to understand the truth of [[The High Gods]]. It holds a sacred place in that religion to this day, and is a site of pilgrimage for many.
