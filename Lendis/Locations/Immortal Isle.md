The Immortal Isle is ruled by the Lich known as [[The Fist of Order]]. Undead are commonplace on this island, being used for all manner of manual labor. Few households lack at least one undead servitor, and state sponsored necromancy schools provide powerful overseers capable of controlling large bands of undead for labor-intensive projects. Other people view Immortal Islanders as being lazy and corrupt, but the islanders see themselves as a beacon of learning and culture.

### History

Little is known about [[The Fist of Order]] before he established the [[Deathless Citadel]]. Five hundred years ago, the Immortal Isle was a wild unsettled land infested by [[The Nightmare|Nightmares]]. The Fist of Order arrived one day and used his immense arcane power to lay waste to the monsters and raise his citadel. Through unknown rituals, he created an aura of necromantic power across the entire island, making it far easier to animate the dead and control them. The world braced for the declaration of a dark empire of death, but was surprised to find that he threw open his doors and welcomed settlers under his protection.

What followed was several generations of tense relations with other states. Many cultures viewed the undead as an abomination, and opposed The Fist of Order on principal. But as the years passed without him invading the mainland with hordes of undead, people slowly grew tired of constantly opposing a threat that never materialized. 150 years ago, the Silver [[Dragon Lord]] [[Marilectar]] visited the Isle in person. When he left, he declared that he had no quarrel with the Lich King, and opened official diplomatic relations between the Dragon Empire and the Immortal Isle.

### Culture

On the Immortal Isle, the undead do the vast majority of manual labor. While some people keep personal gardens or workshops as a hobby, large scale farming and industry have very few mortals working in them. As a result, the people of the Immortal Isle have a great deal of free time on their hands, and are funded directly by [[The Fist of Order]]. State sponsored schools and centers for a wide range of arts and scholarly fields are present in every town and village. While necromancy is obviously held in great esteem, The Fist of Order seems eager to see his people learn and experience anything they wish.

The cost of this luxury and learning is the one tax The Fist of Order extracts from his living subjects. Upon death, their bodies become his property to be animated and put to work. While the native islanders have grown up with this concept and don't seem to mind, the idea alienates a great many potential immigrants. There is substantial debate over whether animating mindless undead from a corpse also enslaves or harms the soul. While there is little evidence either way, it is a point of sore contention between the scholars of the Immortal Isle and elsewhere.

### Government

The government of the Immortal Isle is synonymous with [[The Fist of Order]]. His rule is absolute, and nobody has the power to counter his commands. While a wide range of mortal officials carry out his edicts and manage day to day affairs, he punishes corruption or insurrection with death, leaving the officials as little more than extensions of his will. Laws are strictly enforced, but are relatively generous with what actions they permit.

As a lich, the Fist of Order does not need to sleep or eat. He spends nearly every moment working to further his vision for what his country should be like. He meets with every citizen of the isle when they turn 16 for a private conversation to learn more about them, and so knows all of his people personally - although he naturally isn't especially close with most of them. Any citizen can petition to meet with him to have their concerns addressed, or to seek his advice.

### Religion

[[The Fist of Order]] allows freedom of religion on the island, and many people take him up on that. Most religions in the world - except for [[Nightmare cults]] - are present in some numbers. Missionaries are welcome to visit and preach to their hearts content, but are subject to the same laws as any citizen of the Isle. However, most people end up worshipping the [[Lich King]] himself - a practice he neither requires nor discourages.

For those who worship the Lich King, undeath becomes a holy state. Some people have become sentient undead, following in his footsteps. A small cadre of liches and mummies act as the high priests of the religion, guiding people on their path to undeath. The Fist of Order welcomes these fellow undead, but makes very clear that anyone who becomes a sentient undead must do so of their own free will. Forcefully binding a person's soul against their will is punished by death.

### Military

Like most jobs, the military is filled with undead. Hordes of skeletons and zombies stand ready to defend the Isle from external threats, and state sponsored necromancers are ready to command them. Additionally, [[The Fist of Order]] himself is the most powerful arcane caster on [[Lendis]], and will directly fight against any foe who would threaten his pet project. As a result of this immense power, it has very rarely been used. The Isle is difficult to invade and has a nearly limitless army to defend it, so very few would-be enemies bother to try.

As a result of the Necromantic ritual that covers the Isle, [[the Nightmare]] very rarely manifests. However, some Nighmares cross the water to reach the Isle. Whenever they are detected, they are thrown back, but the people of the Isle must always be vigilant against this threat. Nightmares seem drawn to the Isle from the outside, and it is only the difficulty of crossing the sea that keeps the Isle from being constantly under siege.

### Names

The initial wave of settlers who arrived after [[The Fist of Order]] declared the isle was open to the living came from a wide range of cultural backgrounds, leading to an equally diverse set of names becoming commonplace. [[Riverfolk]] names are especially common here, with [[Ravidhold|Ravidholder]] names being a close second. However, as the generations passed a trend to give their children descriptive names - inspired by the Fist of Order - began to emerge. These names aren't separated by masculine or feminine identities. Family names are seldom used in normal conversation, but are present for formal documents or legal ownership. For example, you could have Walker of Shadows of the Dorinson Family. Some family names have hybridized between Riverfolk, Ravhidhold, and Immortal Islander naming schemes.
