[[Mechanics|Mechanics and House Rules]]

Lendis is a continent in the southern hemisphere of its planet. It is typically divided into nine regions, based on geographical features.

In the far south, the [[Worldbirth Mountains]] are home to two major Dwarf kingdoms. They are extremely cold and inhospitable on the surface, but arteries of magma beating throughout the mountains keep it warm in the tunnels carved by the Dwarves. The Dwarves who live here believe that this region was the first section of the world formed by the [[The High Gods|High God]] Takun.

North of the Worldbirth Mountains are the Rivers of Lagun, also called the [[Riverlands]], a region dominated by two major river networks, and crisscrossed by innumerable smaller streams. Two human city states dominate this region, and have long been rivals with each other.

Continuing North, there is a temperate region called [[Allerai]]. The Republic of [[Lorin]] is the greatest power in this region, but the Dwarves of [[Zhorhold]] keep Lorinâ€™s control from being absolute.

Beyond Allerai is the [[Tempest Desert]]. A vast desert plagued by frequent sandstorms and monster attacks, it is nonetheless the safest land route between the North and South, and possesses several rare magical materials that can be found nowhere else. The Courts of [[Minabald]] and the Orcish domain of [[Kar'Dan's Seat|Kar]] fight over the scarce resources and trade income the desert provides.

Along the Northern edge of the continent, across the [[Sea of Panthar]], lies [[Tulone]], a warm and fertile land. The [[Dragon Empire]] controls the entire region, and is the largest and most powerful state on Lendis. The Dragonspine Mountains are prominent in the Western half of Tulone, which are said to be the fossilized remains of the First Dragon, Xeltuargeud.

Connecting Tulone and Allerai is the [[Forest of Night]], an enormous magical forest where the sun never shines. This forest is home to an immense number of Nightmares, twisted monsters created by magic currents. Two fortresses, positioned at either end of the forest, act as watches and bastions against monstrosities emerging from the dark wood.

Between the Forest of Night and the Tempest Desert lie the [[Drakwald Mountains]]. These mountains are home to countless giant clans and dragon lairs, each lording as a petty tyrant over their individual peak or isolated valley. The Dwarf nation of [[Drakhold]] holds out against these dangers, but has been on a slow decline for all of living memory.

Off the Northeastern coast is the Isle of [[Degand]], a largely untamed and wild region full of ancient ruins and monster tribes. A single fortified settlement - [[Rathenschloss]] - provides support and shelter for the adventurers who are trying to tame the land.

Off the Southeastern coast is the [[ Immortal Isle]]. Home to the ancient Lich known as [[The Fist of Order]], the people who dwell there live side by side with undead and stranger creations.
