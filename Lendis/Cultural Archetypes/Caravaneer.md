You were raised in one of the halfling [[Caravans]] that travel the land. Optimistic wanderers, they eagerly seek out new sights and experiences, making a slow circuit of the continent to see and learn whatever they can, and to share it with those they visit.
At 1st level you gain the Caravanner feat.

description: "You are able to create a ramshackle [[Cart]] or [[Wagon]] out of spare parts and materials scavenged from your environment. This is a downtime action that takes one hour, but requires no cost to be paid or Crafting checks. After this action is complete, you create a Cart or Wagon with half the normal HP and BT. You may only have one such vehicle at a time, attempting to make a new one causes your previous vehicle to fall apart. \nYou are trained in the [[chapter-4-skills#Lore (Int)|Driving Lore]] skill; if you were already trained in Driving Lore, you become trained in another skill of your choice."
