When you create a character, choose one of the following Cultural Archetypes. You gain the first listed feat at level 1 for free. Any time you would gain a Class or Ancestry feat, you may choose an Archetype Feat from your chosen Cultural Archetype instead. You may not choose feats from any Cultural Archetype other than the one you chose at level 1. You may only select the Additional Feats for your cultural archetype if you have taken the Dedication feat for that archetype. Instead of taking a Cultural Archetype, you may select a General Feat for which you qualify.

The available Cultural Archetypes are:
- [[Burgher]]
- [[Caravaneer]]
- [[Elemental Court]]
- [[Immortal Islander]]
- [[Imperial]]
- [[Ironforged]]
- [[Riverfolk]]
- [[Settler]]
- [[Stone Bound]]
- [[Watcher of Night]]
- [[Worldbirth Mountain Folk]]
