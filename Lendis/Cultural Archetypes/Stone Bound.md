The Dwarves of [[Zhorhold]] believe that the earth beneath their feet is a living thing, a god of immense size and power. Those raised among the faithful learn to listen to their [[The Living Stone|god]]â€™s voice, to interpret meaning in the slightest tremor or diffusion of heat. To others, the stone is a dead thing to be carved and broken. But those with the wisdom to hear know that it is alive, and aware of the small mortals living on its surface. At 1st level you gain the Stone Bound feat.

description: "Your culture is experienced in shaping and working stone, using it like other cultures do metal. Any steel weapon or armor in the Plate category can be made from stone at no additional cost (although you may need to find artisans able to perform the special stoneworking methods used by your culture). When you are using such items, they function identically to steel items. When characters without this feat attempt to use them, subtract 1 from the AC of any stone armor, 1 from the damage of stone weapons, and reduce stone shields to Hardness 4 HP(BT) 16(8).\nYou become Trained in [[chapter-4-skills#Crafting (Int)|Crafting]]. If you were already Trained in crafting, you become Trained in a skill of your choice instead. You gain the [[specialty-crafting|Specialty Crafting]] feat with a focus in Stonemasonry. Stonemasonry applies to rolls to repair or make stone equipment."
