Burghers are the people born and raised in a city ruled not by a monarch, but by the will of the people. While many of these early democracies have deep flaws in who is allowed to vote and hold office, they are a growing presence in the world. Burghers reject the archaic hierarchies that much of the world still embraces, and do not suffer lords to determine their fate. At 1st level you gain the Burgher feat.
