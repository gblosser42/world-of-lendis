Riverfolk were born and raised among the countless rivers of [[Riverlands|Lagun]]. They learn to swim at the same time they learn to walk, and can navigate even the most treacherous of waters in their sleep. Regarded as canny merchants and fierce warriors, Riverfolk are an independent and clannish people. At 1st level you gain the Riverfolk feat.

**Additional Feats:** **4th** [[reactive-shield|Reactive Shield]], **6th** [[shielded-stride|Shielded Stride]], **10th** [[quick-shield-block-fighter|Quick Shield Block]]
