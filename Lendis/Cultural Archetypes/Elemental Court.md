The Elemental planes are the closest to the Material, and the elementals who dwell there reflect mortal forms and understandings. In places of powerful elemental magic, such as the [[Tempest Desert]], elementals are a common sight who exist side by side with mortals. Where this mingling is strongest, the descendants of elementals and mortals - called Geniekin - become commonplace. Living in a society split between material affairs and the inhuman majesty of elementals, people find a way to exist and thrive despite their unique situation. 
At 1st level, you gain the Elemental Court feat.
**Additional Feats:** **8th** Improved Elemental Blast, **12th** Expert Kinetic Control
