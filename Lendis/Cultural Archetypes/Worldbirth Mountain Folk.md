The Dwarves of the [[Worldbirth Mountains]] practice magical crafts that are in high demand the world over. Few members of their society are unable to cast simple spells, and even their ordinary tools tend to have minor enchantments. The Worldbirth Mountains are home to high quality materials of every type, and their wealth is the envy of other cultures. At 1st level you gain the Worldbirth Mountains feat.

description: "You are trained in [[chapter-4-skills#Crafting (Int)|Crafting]]; if you were already trained, you become an expert instead. You can cast spells. Choose any spell tradition. You gain access to the Cast a Spell activity. You gain a spell repertoire with one common cantrip associated with your chosen tradition. Your key spellcasting ability for Worldbirth Mountain Folk archetype spells is Wisdom. \nWhen crafting any non-magical permanent item, you may choose to increase the DC by 2 before rolling. If you do, and you successfully craft the item, you may choose one of the following benefits to apply to the item: \n- Activate ⬻ Interact; Effect The item sheds light like a torch for 10 minutes or until this action is taken again to stop the light.\n - Reduce the Bulk of the item by 1, to a minimum of 1 Bulk.\n - Activate ⬻ Interact; Effect The item hovers in place for 1 minute. Any significant force exerted upon the item (more than a pound, or more than Light bulk) causes this ability to deactivate and the item to drift safely to the ground. \n - Activate ⬺ Command; Effect This item can perform some simple task associated with its function upon command, such as a rope untying itself or a book turning a page. This effect can never cause damage or status effects. \n - If the item is able to hold a set amount of Bulk, it can hold 1 additional Bulk. This does not modify the total Bulk, just the maximum capacity. \n - Activate ⬻ Command; Effect The item makes some predetermined noise, or performs some simple action, such as a doll dancing. You cannot imitate the voice of a specific person unless that person voluntarily assists in the creation of the item. \n - Activate ⬻ Command; Effect This item moves towards you at a rate of 10 feet per turn, unless blocked or restrained. This speed is not fast enough to cause damage, and this option cannot be chosen for items with a Bulk greater than 1. \n - Activate ⬻ Interact; Effect The item changes appearance slightly, such as altering the color or cut of clothing \n - The item is noticeably warm or cold to the touch. This isn’t extreme enough to cause damage or offset extreme temperatures \n - You can grant the item a [[quirks-gmg|Quirk]] of your choice, other than the 99-100 options \nThis causes the item to register as magical, but does not count as magical for the purposes of overcoming resistance. If you acquire this feat at character creation, you may choose to have up to two of your items purchased at character creation benefit from its effects."
