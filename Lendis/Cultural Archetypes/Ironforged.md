For thousands of years, orcs have been regarded as barbarians, savage raiders who prey on civilization and must be fought at every turn. Over time, the orc tribes have been beaten back, driven from the borders of other nations. Facing potential extinction, the survivors banded together and fled into the [[Tempest Desert]]. Here, they have been reforged into something new. A unified people, ready to carve out a place for themselves in the world by wit and by will - and by blood if necessary. At 1st level, you gain the Ironforged feat.
