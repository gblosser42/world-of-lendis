The Church of [[the Heavenly Choir]] venerates music as a holy expression. As such, those who express themselves through music are respected in [[Lorin]] and are incorporated into many religious ceremonies. Those who are inspired by the divine blur the line between bard and cleric, using their music to express their faith.
**Additional Feats:** **1st** Domain Initiate; **8th** Advanced Domain
#### Cantor                            1st
Inspired by the perfect music of the Heavenly Choir, you use your performances to show your devotion. You must select Cantor Dedication as your 2nd level class feat or free archetype selection.
**Prerequisites:** You must be a bard.
**Cantor Adjustments:** You must be a follower of The Heavenly Choir.
You are trained in Religion instead of Occultism.
You use the Divine spell list instead of the Occult spell list. Your Composition spells are Occult.
Any class feat or ability that references Occultism instead uses Religion.
You must choose the Choir muse (see below) for your muse.

##### Choir Muse
Your muse is related to the Heavenly Choir itself, which sang the world into existence. For many cantors, a specific [[Choir Gods|Choir God]] fills role, while for others it is the Choir as a whole or a particular religious figure. Art inspired by a choir muse is emotionally stirring, and laden with religious meaning.
**Muse Feat** Echoing Choir
**Muse Spell** [[concordant-choir-som|Concordant Choir]]
