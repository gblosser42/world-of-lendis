[[Lendis]] is closely tied to the elemental planes, and elemental spirits abound throughout the world. You have specialized in communing with these spirits, and connect with nature more than the divine.
**Additional Feats:** **1st** Elemental Familiar; **2nd** Voice of the Elements; **14th** Nourishing Gate
#### Elemental Channeler                            1st
Inspired by the perfect music of the Heavenly Choir, you use your performances to show your devotion. You must select Elemental Channeler Dedication as your 2nd level class feat or free archetype selection.
**Prerequisites:** You must be an Animist and Trained in Nature.
**Cantor Adjustments:** 
You use the Primal spell list instead of the Divine spell list. Your Vessel spells are Primal, and all spells gained through Apparition spells are Primal.
Any class feat or ability that references Religion instead uses Nature.
You must choose the Naturist practice (see below) for your animistic practice.
When using or acquiring feats via this archetype, you are considered to have the following elements based on your primary apparition:
* Crafter in the Vault: Fire and Metal
* Custodian of Groves and Gardens: Air and Wood
* Lurker in Devouring Dark: Air and Water
* Stalker in Darkened Boughs: Metal and Wood
* Steward of Stone and Fire: Earth and Fire
* Vanguard of Roaring Waters: Earth and Water
If your primary apparition is not listed above, you are considered to have one element of your choice. If you have an Elemental Familiar, you must change its form to match an element you have after your daily preparations.

##### Naturist
You are especially close to spirits of nature and the elements, and can touch upon the planes they hail from.
**Invocation of Power (1st)** You gain the Channeler's Stance feat.
**Invocation of the Elements (9th)** When you Cast or Sustain an apparition spell that deals energy damage, you gain Resistance to that type of damage equal to your level until the start of your next turn.
**Invocation of Nature (17th)** When you roll initiative, you can use Channeler's Stance as a free action. If your first action on your first turn is to cast an apparition spell that deals energy damage, you reduce the number of actions it takes to cast it by 1 (to a minimum of 1 action).
