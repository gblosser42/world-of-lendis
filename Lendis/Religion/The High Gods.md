The stars above are gods, each one dwelling within a single perfect gem. The first High King, [[Thax]], saw the truth of the stars revealed to him in the [[Mirror of Stars]] - a perfectly still and reflective lake holy to this religion. The High Gods reveal the truth of the future to those who can watch and measure their movements, and the priests of this faith are skilled astronomers and mathematicians. It is also believed that another perfect gem, the seed of a new God, lies deep within the earth somewhere. For this reason, the dwarves of the [[Worldbirth Mountains]] delve and mine.
