There are no Outer Planes connected to [[Lendis]]. The gods worshiped by the various faiths do not manifest or send angels to act on their behalf (except if the religion worships an existing person, such as the Lich King’s cult), nor do fiends or other non-godly outsiders. Like in our real world, religion on Lendis is a matter of faith, not a clear and unambiguous fact. Clerics and other divine casters still receive spells and domain gifts where appropriate, but there is substantial in-setting debate over the nature and origin of these powers. Many of the faiths described below have mutually exclusive histories, beliefs, and myths. Each entry will present that faith as being correct, but that should not be taken as an objective statement of fact.

Spells that summon an extraplanar entity from the Outer Planes instead create such an entity, whose appearance reflects what the caster’s faith would expect. Spells that rely on divine power for divination, but that do not involve direct communication with the divine, such as Augury, function as normal. Spells and other effects cannot raise the dead once the soul has departed, a process that typically takes about a minute. Spells that can travel to other planes can only travel to or from the Inner Planes, the Ethereal Plane, or the Astral Plane. Spells that directly communicate with a deity or its agents, such as using Commune with the Religion skill, do not function and cannot be used. Anathema limitations, such as from the Champion or Cleric classes, function normally but are caused by an internal crisis of faith rather than external punishment.
