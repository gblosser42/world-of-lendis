The planet itself is a god, mother and father to all life upon its surface. Far from an inert ball of matter, it is aware of mortals and can whisper truths to guide them. For those with the patience and wisdom to listen, the stone can guide every aspect of your life. The Living Stone knows everything connected to its surface, especially unbroken natural stone. With this near omniscience, it can whisper of plans and prophecies unknown to the surface dwellers. The priests of the Living Stone are especially trained to hear these words, and offer interpretation and life guidance to their flock.
