In the Republic of [[Lorin]], it is known that the world was sung into existence by a great host of [[Choir Gods|divinities]], each singing or playing a slight variation upon the same truth. Due to this, each god has a different perspective on the world, and connects with different aspects of mortal life. To worship the Heavenly Choir is to worship all of them, respecting the thousand voices that made the world. The life of a faithful Choirist is one of ritual and small offerings, giving thanks to the gods and praying for their guidance.

It is a rare home without at least one shrine, and many have more than one. Music and song are sacred to followers of this religion, and sermons are always delivered lyrically.
