The Choir Gods are the host of divinities worshipped by [[The Heavenly Choir]] religion. Thousands of small local gods are worshipped, with each household having its own minor god, as do many locations or concepts. Below is a list of some of the most important Choir Gods, those worshipped throughout Lorin.

- **Excelcus** the Conductor. Exelcus guides the other gods in their roles, but does not truly command them. They are not a Head God or even First Among Equals, but more of a mentor figure. They are a patron of teachers and tutors.
- **Locata** the Prima Donna. Her voice stands out among the others, and her role in the music of creation set the tone for others to follow. She was a patron of the nobility, but her worship has seen a decline since the establishment of the Republic.
- **Umbril** the Bass. His voice echoes deep through the waves, and his music created the oceans and rivers. He is the patron of sailors and merchants, and ships bearing his sigil were responsible for Lorin's dominance at sea.
- **Nevine** the Alto. Her voice echoes with the hammer's fall and the pick's strike, and it was she who seeded the land with metal and gems. She is the patron of smiths and bankers, bringing steel and gold alike.
- **Rasmon** the Tenor. His voice split the day and night, and carved out the first homestead. He stands watch against [[The Nightmare]], and against mortal danger. He is the patron of the home, and most respected by watchmen and guards.
