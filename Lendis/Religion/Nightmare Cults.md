While worship of [[The Nightmare]] is not tolerated in any large society, there nonetheless exist some nihilistic cultists desperate enough to turn to The Nightmare for power. These cults perform dark rituals and sacrifices in order to draw The Nightmare to them, in hopes of creating a powerful Nightmare event. Most meet their end at the hands of the very creatures they summon.
