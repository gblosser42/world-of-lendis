The Dragon Ideal holds the five metallic dragons as paragons for mortals to strive to live up to. Each one has aspects of the Ideal Life, a reflection of the perfect dragon - The Platinum Dragon. Priests of this religion understand the Platinum Dragon to be a metaphor for the spiritual ideal they are pursuing rather than a literal entity, but most lay people donâ€™t make that distinction.

Followers of the Dragon Ideal tend to pick one Metallic Dragon to attempt to emulate, focusing their efforts on improving and acting along that line. A handful of dedicated practitioners aim for the Platinum Dragon Ideal, a high standard to hold themselves to.

Each Ideal has a different set of Edicts and Anathema, as well as different Devotee Benefits. All Ideals have the [[heal|Heal]] Divine Font.

The six Dragon Ideals are: The [[Brass Ideal]], The [[Bronze Ideal]], The [[Copper Ideal]], The [[Gold Ideal]], The [[Silver Ideal]], and The [[Platinum Ideal]].
