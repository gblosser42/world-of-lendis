In a solemn hall deep within [[Drakhold]], [[The Made Gods|the Made Gods]] sit. Fourteen massive statues, each carved in perfect detail and each made to contain a God. Four thousand years ago, The Speaker of Truth foretold a prophecy, of fourteen mortals of perfect skill and power, whoâ€™s actions would carve the fate of the world. He carved the statues, each engraved with the prophecy corresponding to it, in preparation for these souls to be found. When his work was done, he died and his soul entered the first. Eleven statues have been filled, eleven mortals whose actions remade the world around them and earned godhood. Today, the priests tend to the statues to ensure the favor and attention of the Made Gods within them, and the people of Drakhold pray to the Made Gods for mercy and salvation. And the Searchers for Truth comb the world for the remaining three. For when the final Made God - The Herald of the End - is found, they will decide how the world shall perish, and what new world will rise from its ashes.
