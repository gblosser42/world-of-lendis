The [[Made Gods]] dwell within the fourteen massive statues at the heart of [[Drakhold]]. Each Made God began as a mortal who was deified through their actions. While only eleven have been found so far, it is a matter of doctrine that each always has been and always will be a Made God. Three mortals alive today - or who have yet to be born - are Gods and do not yet realize it: The Spark of Revolution, The Traitor of Hope, and The Herald of the End.

- **The Speaker of Truth**, the first Made God to be found, who spoke the Prophecy of the End
- **The Herald of the End**, the final Made God who will be found, who will destroy this world and remake the next.
- **The Whisper of Night**, who brought a great kingdom to ruin through rumor alone.
- **The Mother of All**, whose children each rose to rule a different realm, and all answered to her.
- **The Guardian of the Hearth**, who held off a horde of nightmares alone, and slew a Scourge.
- **The Butcher of Life**, who murdered a hundred victims without ever being caught.
- **The Forger of Fire**, who crafted artifacts without equal, including a shield made of Nightmare itself.
- **The Judge of Souls**, who could never be fooled by lies, and always delivered Justice.
- **The Spark of Revolution**, who will lead a great uprising, and uproot a great order.
- **The Tamer of Beasts**, who humbled a Scourge and made it kneel in service.
- **The Singer of Hearts**, whose music and art made a mountain weep and a river part willingly.
- **The Thief of Stars**, who stole a star from the sky and wove it into a necklace.
- **The Traitor of Hope**, who will bring about ruin after offering salvation and peace.
- **The Bringer of Light**, who revealed a Nightmare plot and saved a kingdom from corruption.
