While [[The Fist of Order]] does not demand that his subjects worship him, many do. His mastery over undeath and command of the land upon which they live makes him a manifest god to the people of the [[Immortal Isle]]. They pray to the Lich King for guidance, for protection, and for the safe shepherding of their souls and the souls of their loved ones after death.
