To those who follow The Living Story, the world is a great stage, a vibrant story being told by The Author, and each of us has a part to play. They believe the world came into being when The Author began telling its Story, and will end when the Story does. They pray for guidance to fulfill their roles, and see pattern and plot in everyday happenstance. Players tend to try to adopt a narrative role, and will base their behavior and decisions upon that role and what would make for the best story more than what outsiders consider common sense.
