The gods are real. Not the fanciful myths and lies told by other cultures, nor the jumped-up mortals worshiped by some. The true gods have yet to be discovered, or perhaps have yet to reveal themselves. And so it falls to every mortal to strive, to seek, and to prove their worth. For only when one is worthy will the True Gods be found, and guide the way to salvation.
